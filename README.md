# RPNuCalc
The RPNuCalc is an ideal tool for experimenters and makers who are looking for a compact and programmable calculator. The credit card-sized device runs on Reverse Polish Notation algorithms and is written in CircuitPython, an open-source programming language designed to simplify microcontroller programming. With its small form factor, it is convenient to carry and can easily fit in a wallet or cardholder, making it ideal for on-the-go experimentation. The programmable feature allows users to create custom programs and functions, increasing efficiency and productivity during experiments. The RPN method of calculation provides a different and potentially more efficient approach for specific calculations. The calculator is powered by the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip and CircuitPython, making it a powerful and user-friendly tool for experimenters.
