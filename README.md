# RPNuCalc
RPNuCalc is a credit card sized programmable RPN calculator written in CircuitPython. 
It is a compact and portable calculator that runs on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) algorithms. 
It is programmed using CircuitPython, an open-source programming language that is designed to simplify the process of programming microcontroller boards. 
Its compact design allows it to easily fit in a wallet or cardholder, making it convenient for everyday use or for use on-the-go. 
The calculator is programmable, meaning it allows users to write and store custom programs and functions for repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. 
It operates using RPN algorithms, which is a different method of entering calculations compared to traditional calculators and can be more efficient for certain types of calculations. 
This type of calculator combines the convenience of a portable, credit card sized form factor with the power of programmability and RPN calculation, all powered by the ease of use provided by CircuitPython and the new Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip.
